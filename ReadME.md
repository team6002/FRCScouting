# 6002 ZooBOTix's scouting script using the blue alliances & statbotics API.

to use this script you need to create a BlueAlliance read key from https://thebluealliance.com/account
and put in a json file called X-TBA-Auth-Key.json in the format of
{
"key": "your-TBA-Auth-Key-here"
}
you also need a service account from google and the credentials from that in a json file called credentials.json
